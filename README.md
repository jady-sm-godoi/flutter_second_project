This is my second project on Flutter. The project was proposed in the course: Learn Flutter and Develop Apps For Android and IOS 2021 - A Complete Course to Learn Google Flutter and Dart for Building Native Apps for iOS and Android. This course was created by Leonardo Moura Leitao and Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller. It is available on Udemy at https://www.udemy.com/course/curso-flutter/
